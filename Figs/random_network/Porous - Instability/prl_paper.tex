\section{Introduction}
%
Fluid flow through a porous medium can dynamical change the pore-level micro-structure by eroding and/or material deposition/sedimentation. Such  changes to micro-structure and solid boundaries affect local fluid flow as well as bulk behaviors. These processes of erosion or deposition in porous media play essential role in many environmental and industrial applications such as groundwater remediation and precipitation of minerals in rocks, bio-film growth in water filtration, or enhanced oil recovery with polymer flooding, water-deriven erosion. The structures of such porous media are usually highly disordered with a hetereogeneous distribution of pore-level flow velocities.




% Albeit there is an abundance of applications, the evolution of structures exposed to erosion and deposition is in general not easily predictable and usually requires the use of numerical techniques.


% However, this process is difficult to model due to diverse processes that may arise, including particle advection through the pore space by fluid flow, adsorption and deposition onto the solid matrix, and erosion or resuspension.

\section{Methods}
%
Flow through pores and throats of a porous medium can be modeled using a network of tubes with varying radii ( Fig. \ref{fig:fig1}a,b). In this network, the pores are represented with nodes, and the throats are modeled as simple tubes where the diameters/length can be random. where they approximate the flow resistance between the pores. A structured network of nodes with a random distribution of flow resistances for edges has shown to be a valid approximate model that correctly captures the exponential distribution of velocities of a porous medium. Here we consider this similar model to obtain some insights of structural change effects. We consider a fluid with density $\rho$ and kinematic viscosity $\mu$ flowing through the pores. We consider low Reynolds fluid or Poiseuille flow. In each tube Darcy's law hold $ P_i - P_j  = \frac{128 \mu L_{ij} }{\pi d_{ij}^4} Q_{ij}$ where $P_i,P_j$ represents pressures at pores $i,j$, and $d_{ij}, L_{ij}, Q_{ij}$ are respectively the radius, length, and fluid flow rate in the tube connecting pores $i$ and $j$. We then consider a network grid and assume a pressure difference between nodes left and the right boundary. Due to conservation of mass at each node, the total flow into a node should add up to zero. Solving for conservation of mass at all nodes, a system of equations can be obtained, where the solution is the pressures at all nodes. Using pressure values at the nodes, the flow rate in each tube is then obtained using Darcy's law. Considering different distribution of radius/length of the tubes, we find that the for any distribution, with large enough disorder the distribution of normalized fluid flux in the tubes collapses on a universal curve where $P(\hat{q}) \propto e^{-\alpha \hat{q}}$ for large $\hat{q}$ where $\hat{q}$ is the normalized fluid flux $\hat{q} = {q}/\langle q \rangle$. This can be simply proved using a mean field approximation (See supp material).

\section{Results}
\subsection{Simulation results for grid networks and random networks}
We run simulations on grid networks and random 2D networks. Both show similar results. For erosion cases, $n=3$ is a critical point that the final states will retain the exponential tail of flow distribution. When $n<3$, the erosion law yields channelling effect which strengthens a few tube faster than the rest. When $n>3$, the
